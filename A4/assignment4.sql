-- do select and order by
-- maybe use order by (sort)....on a non key field....now when you have an index it will be much faster
-- he difficulty is in determining what columns need indexing and whether enforcing uniqueness is necessary. ..specify unique index maybe
-- Deciding which fields should be indexed involves several considerations. If you have a field involved in searching, grouping, or sorting, indexing it will likely result in a performance gain. These include fields that are part of join operations or fields that appear with clauses such asWHERE, GROUP BY, or ORDER BY.

-- put screenshots of explain command before and after adding indices....in the report
-- While indexes are really good when trying to find particular information on a table, they canâ€™t help us when we need all the information in it. 
-- join on indexed vs non indexed
-- list down the initially present indices in the concerned tables
